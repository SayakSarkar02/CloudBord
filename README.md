# What is CloudBord?

Nowdays, most people have several machines (PCs, Phone, Tablets etc.) working simultaneously.
I find myself facing the problem of transferring simple links or codes over to different devices.
Thus, I decided to create ClouBord.

CloudBord is a Web Application which enables users to have a Local Area Network (LAN) clipboard.
CloudBord helps users to have a common clipboard for all devices in a LAN where one can copy, cut and paste text and media seamlessly across all devices.

## Features I want to implement

Presently **CloudBord** is just a front-end website and needs a back-end.

- A backend is needed to connect the different devices over LAN.
- Features like Copy,Cut & Paste needs to be implemented.
